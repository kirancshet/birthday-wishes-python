## About <a name = "about"></a>

This python script allows the user to schedule an email in Python. 

You often come across a number of instances, where we need to send an email at a specific time rather than immediately. For instance, birthday of your friends, anniversary, weekly financial report to your client to name a few. In principle, you can send the email manually every time, however, we can as well automate the entire process through a scheduler. In this article, we will explore how to schedule an email in Python.
